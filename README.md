### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The biggest challenge encountered was initializing the YouTube Player and setting up its logistics. There are multiple instances of errors which can be problematic. FOr example, when running the app on API 30+, you get the message "An error has occurred while initializing the YouTube player." The solution required adding an action to the AndroidManifest.xml file. Additionally, the same error can be generated if you do not have the Google Play app installed on your device.

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
  - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The most notable challenge was having to implement JSON exceptions. This was due to the fact that I was not very experienced with JSON or AsyncHttpClient. There was a try and catch exception that needed to be implemented within the MainActivity file when using AsyncHttpClient, and two other exceptions within Movie.java.
